# Introduction/Business Problem
This project is trying to recommend a location for someone looking to open a restaurant in New York City.
We will work on finding the answer to the following questions:
1. Where are the popular locations for running a restaurant business?
2. Are there any geographical patterns in these popular restaurants?
3. What are the frequencies of these restaurants being mentioned by users of Foursquare?
4. Are there any patterns in these mostly mentioned restaurants?
